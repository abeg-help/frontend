		answer: (
			<>
				<p>Here&apos;s how fundraising on AbegHelp.me works:</p>
				<p>
					To get started, just tap the &apos;Start fundraiser&apos; button.
					After a few questions to help set up your fundraiser, you&apos;ll then
					write your fundraising story. Next, you&apos;ll customize your
					fundraiser, adding details to let potential donors understand your
					cause.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once your fundraiser is live, you can always add additional photos and
					videos or lower or raise your goal anytime. The best way to raise
					funds is by sharing your fundraiser. Call family, text friends,
					message coworkers, or post your fundraiser link on social media to
					help you reach your fundraising goal.

		question: "How does AbegHelp.me keep fundraisers safe?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					AbegHelp.me features the very best in secure payment encryption
					technology. Your donors&apos; online payments are safe, and your money
					is stored securely until you&apos;re ready to request a withdrawal via

		),
	},
	{
		question: "Can a friend withdraw the money I raise for them?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					Yes. AbegHelp.me makes it easy for another friend or family member to
					securely access the funds you have raised. Through AbegHelp.me, they
					will receive direct access to the money you have raised. Please note:
					You will not be able to enter their bank information during the
					withdrawal process; they will need to do this themselves.
				</p>
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "Are there any deadlines or time limits?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					While there are important withdrawals deadlines you&apos;ll need to
					observe to avoid donations being refunded to donors, your fundraiser
					will remain live until you choose to turn off donations or remove the
					fundraiser altogether. Most organizers leave their fundraisers active
					indefinitely to refer back to the kind comments and support they
					received.
				</p>
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "What if I do not reach my goal?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					No problem. Reaching your goal is not required. With AbegHelp.me, you
					keep each and every donation you receive. Your fundraiser will be able
					to accept donations even after your goal is reached. Once the goal is
					reached, the progress meter on your fundraiser will show that you have
					received more than your goal amount. If you&apos;d like to continue
					raising money, you can keep your fundraiser running for as long as
					you&apos;d like.
				</p>
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "How do I get donations?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					AbegHelp.me provides an easy way to raise money from your friends,
					family, and online community. Our platform makes it simple to share
					your fundraiser in a variety of ways to bring in donations, track your
					progress, and post updates to engage your community.
